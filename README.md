# swingy

A minimal text-based RPG simulator used to explore model-view-controller design and GUI switching in Java.

## Project overview

A high-level design focuses on teaching Java GUI development using SWING, emphasizing clean object-oriented architecture and classic design patterns. The application enables hero creation, stat progression, and map-based gameplay through console and GUI modes, supporting future extensibility.

### Provided by the architect

- Guidelines for Model-View-Controller architecture
- Requirements for using Java, Maven, and annotation-based validation
- Clear instructions on minimizing dependencies and following Java best practices

### Goals

- Simulate RPG scenarios with hero types, movement, battles, and leveling up
- Separate UI logic from core logic using MVC
- Switch seamlessly between console and GUI views
- Preserve hero data and extend with database integration (bonus)

## Required knowledge

- Reading and following object-oriented architecture, especially MVC
- Core Java, Maven, and SWING for GUI
- Annotation-based validation using javax.validation libraries
- Clean code design and extensibility principles

## Files in this repository

- `heroes.txt` — persistent storage for hero stats
- `diagram.puml` — class diagram source (if applicable)
